Recent colaborative work between the \acf{NAG} and the \acf{UMinho} presented a blocked approach to the matrix square root algorithm which showed great improvements in a multicore shared memory environment.

Matrix algorithms often deal with large amounts of data at a time, which impairs efficient cache memory usage. Blocked approaches have the benefit of breaking the data domain in chunks sized to maximize cache efficiency.

While the results show improvements for a shared memory environment, distributed memory architectures were left unexplored. In these systems data is distributed accross several shared memory spaces, including those associated to specialized accelerator devices, such as a \acs{GPU}. These latter systems are usually known as \aclp{HetPlat}.

This dissertation focus on porting the blocked matrix square root algorithm implementation to an heterogeneous platform exploring highly tuned implementations for hardware accelerators.
