	\tdg{State-of-the-art chapters}%
	\Cref{chp:techbg,chp:case} provide the background information required to conveniently contextualize the reader. In particular, \cref{chp:techbg} provides an overview on the evolution of \hpc, the hardware characteristics of heterogeneous platforms and the challenges faced by programmers in this area. It also covers some tools to aid with such issues.

	\tdg{Implementation chapters}%
	The following chapters focus on the three mentioned implementations. \Cref{chp:multicore} describes the multicore implementations and further contextualizes the reader with the case study. It also presents the scalability test results and the consequent analysis. \Cref{chp:mic} focuses on the implementation targeted	 for the Intel \mic architecture, the results obtained and optimizations for a better tuning. In a similar fashion, \cref{chp:cuda} does the same for the CUDA implementation.

	\tdg{Conclusion and future work}%
	\Cref{chp:conclusions} presents the conclusions of this dissertation and suggestions for future work, including further optimization opportunities and identified unexplored approaches.
