	\Cref{eq:sqrtm:diag0,eq:sqrtm:diagN} describe an algorithm where each element depends on those at its left in the same row and those below in the same column (Parlett's recurrence \cite{Parlett:1976}). Consequently, the algorithm can be implemented either a column/row or a superdiagonal at a time.

	\tdg{column/row}%
	While the first strategy (column/row) is preferred for any serial implementation due to a more efficient use of cache memory (better locality), it presents almost\footnote{It is possible for this strategy to solve its dependencies in parallel. The following chapters will show this with more detail.} no opportunities for parallelism since no more than one element is ready to be computed at any given time.

	\tdg{super-diagonal}%
	On the other hand, computing a super-diagonal at a time allows for several elements to be computed in parallel since all the dependencies were already computed in previous super-diagonals.
