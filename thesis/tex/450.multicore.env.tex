	\section{Environmental Setup}
	\label{sec:multicore:env}

	Performance tests were run in one computational node of the 701 group in the \search\footnote{\url{http://search.di.uminho.pt}} cluster. This node runs Linux CentOS 6.2 and contains two 8-core \intel\xeon E5-2650 processors and 64GB shared DRAM (NUMA) at 1333 MHz. Each processor runs at a clock frequency of 2.00 GHz and has hardware support for 32 simultaneous threads with \intel Hyper-Threading.

	The executables were compiled using the \intel C++ Compiler, version 12.0.0, linked with \intel\mkl 11.0 (for optimized \blas and \lapack) and Armadillo C++ Linear Algebra library version 3.800.2.
