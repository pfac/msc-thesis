	\label{chp:mic}

	The \mic architecture \cite{Intel:XeonPhi:DevGuide} is \intel's response to the increased demand for \gpgpus as massively parallel hardware accelerators. The conceptual design of these coprocessors is distinct from \gpgpus and it follows \intel's trend to increase the number of cores in its products. These devices are targeted for memory bound problems, unlike \gpus, but \intel will also launch a different version of the chip specially tuned for compute bound problems.
